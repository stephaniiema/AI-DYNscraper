Does the code work? If not, what's broken.
- Sort of works -- is able to extract the information from the YMCA site, but some weird formatting and the site is not able to accept urls thru the UI
How is the code better than what the team currently has?
- It is not better
How is the code worse?
- No UI, weird formatting
How many tries did it take to get the code? Main struggles?
- Many tries and reprompting. I accidentally used GPT 4o (OpenAI put me onto a trial of it without me realizing?), which worked fairly well and then when I tried switching to 3.5 the conversation started going in circles and the code got worse and worse.
Overall impression of the experience
- There might be potential for using GPT4 to extend our app to other sites (a long term goal our client had that we deemed ot be out of scope for this quarter), but I would not use it to create the main infrastructure of this site.
